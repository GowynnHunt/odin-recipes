      A perfect recipe for any weeknight, this spicy yet sweet dish will keep

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Steak</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>350 g (0.75 lb) flank steak (or cut of choice), cubed</li>
      <li>10 g (2 tsp) peanut or neutral oil (for cooking)</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sweet & Spicy Stir Fry Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>10 g (2 tsp) soy sauce</li>
      <li>15 g (1 tbsp) hoisin</li>
      <li>10 g (2 tsp) chili garlic paste (Sambal Oelek)</li>
      <li>5 g (1 tsp) toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sauteed Vegetables</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 shitake mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>
        1/2 bunch of asparagus, woody stem section removed, and chopped into 1‚Äù
        pieces
      </li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>5 g (1 tsp) peanut or neutral oil (for cooking)</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Sprinkle of MSG, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bowl Components & Garnishes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Serving of leftover rice</li>
      <li>Additional toasted sesame seeds</li>
      <li>Pickled ginger</li>
      <li>Scallions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3 g Kewpie Mayo, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Make the sauce:</h3>
    <p>
      Combine all Sweet & Spicy Stir Fry Sauce ingredients together until
      homogenous. Set aside.
    </p>

    <h3>Stir fry the vegetables:</h3>
    <p>
      To cook, heat a wok (or a large fry pan) over high heat. Add 5 grams of
      neutral oil and the garlic and cook for 20 seconds. Add the mushrooms and
      asparagus with a pinch of salt and saute for a couple of minutes. Set
      aside, and wipe the wok clean.
    </p>

    <h3>Stir fry the steak:</h3>
    <p>
      Heat the wok until smoking again and add oil to the pan. Add steak cubes
      and let them sear on one side for a couple of minutes to brown the
      exterior. Toss to release and cook the other sides of the steak, then add
      the stir-fry sauce. Cook for another minute or so to let the sauce reduce
      and glaze the steak.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Assemble and serve:</strong> I added a serving of leftover rice,
      half of the veggies, and more toasted sesame seeds to the steak, but make
      a portion to your desired preference and ratio. Don't forget the
      garnishes: kewpie mayo, leftover sauce, pickled ginger, and scallions.
