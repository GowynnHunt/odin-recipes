    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Chicken Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken breast, thinned out or butterflied</li>
      <li>Drizzle of cooking oil</li>
      <li>Sprinkle of salt</li>
      <li>Spice mix of choice. Two great options to try:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Blackened seasoning mix: paprika, cayenne, thyme, and onion powder</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning mix: oregano, garlic powder, and red pepperflakes</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Calabrian Mayo</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 part calabrian chiles, finely shopped</li>
      <li>3 parts mayo</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sandwich Components</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hoagie style rolls of choice</li>
      <li>Parmesan, shaved or grated</li>
      <li>Lettuce, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Tomato, thinly slced</li>
      <li>Onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>High quality balsamic vinegar (thicker), to drizzle</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cook the chicken:</strong> Coat the thinned chicken breast in a sprinkle of salt and seasoning mix. Add a bit of oil to a pan over medium high heat then add the chicken. Cook until the seasonings “blacken” or form a light crust, making sure to flip frequently while doing so. Use a thermometer to pull the chicken breast at around 155°F (internal temp) and let rest before slicing</li>
      <li>Make<strong> the mayo:</strong> Mix together the mayo and chopped chilies until well combined. Reserve.</li>
      <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Warm or toast the hoagie roll. Meanwhile, chop or gather any other toppings and components you need for the sandwich. Now that the cooked chicken has rested, slice up into thin shavings.</li>
      <li><strong>Assemble & serve:</strong> Add a slather of Calabrian Mayo to the insides of the hoagie roll. Add a serving of warm chicken followed by the remaining Sandwich Components, preferably in the listed order.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding the parmesan directly to the warm chicken will help it melt (feel free to bust out a blowtorch or the broiler to help it along).</li>
        <li>The drizzle of balsamic really brings the sandwich together.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
